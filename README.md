# algorithms
Interviews in major companies test a student's algorithmic skills. So, every student once or the other comes across practising data structures and algorithms. But then the confusion arises, which algorithms & data structures to study. Searching google makes the process even harder as it contains a huge list of algorithms to ace any interview. This is the demotivating point for many students. 
So, in this repository ill add code of every data structure and algorithm that i find useful and even attach videos for better clarification. 
Good luck guys, This process of studying data structures, participating in contests, doing leetcode and interviewing is a really enjoying process. Enjoy it and you won't feel when you land in your dream company.
All the best for your future.
